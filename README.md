Online Ice Cream Store System

This system enables users to conveniently place ice cream orders by adding them to a shopping cart. Users can also remove existing orders, view the total cost of their selected items, and proceed to checkout.

Project Overview
The system is built using five Java classes, each handling different functionalities:

Menu – Manages text-based menus, allowing users to navigate through available options.
IceCreamOrder – Represents individual ice cream orders.
ShoppingCart – Stores ice cream orders in a cart, utilizing a standard Java array for storage.
IceCreamStore – Maintains the shopping cart and provides a user interface for managing orders. Customers can view, update, price, or modify their orders through a menu-driven system.
IceCreamStoreOnline – Serves as the main driver program for running the Ice Cream Store system.
This project provides an easy-to-use ordering experience, allowing customers to manage their ice cream purchases efficiently.
