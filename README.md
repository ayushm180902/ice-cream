Online Ice Cream Store Application

This application allows users to effortlessly add ice cream orders into a shopping cart. They can also delete orders, check the total price of selected items, and finally complete checkout.

Project Outline
The application is structured using five Java classes, each with a distinct responsibility:
Menu — Handles displaying text-based menus and lets users move through different options.
IceCreamOrder — Represents a single ice cream order (for example: flavor, size, and extras).
ShoppingCart — Contains multiple IceCreamOrder objects, implemented using a simple Java array.
IceCreamStore — Oversees the shopping cart and offers a menu-driven interface for customers to add, view, edit, price, or remove orders.
IceCreamStoreOnline — The main driver class, which launches the ice cream store system.
This setup gives users a straightforward, user‑friendly way to manage their ice cream purchases efficiently.
